 ---------------------------- ANALYSIS -------------------------------

 Based off the above results, it seems like the length of time the sorting
 takes initially gets faster, but then takes longer as the recursion limit is
 set to a higher value. Starting at 2, the time taken is relatively fast. As
 the limit moves through the 10-20 range, the time taken decreases by a
 relatively small amount, but still significant. Gradually moving through the
 20's into the 30's and beyond, the sort time continues to grow at a relatively
 consistent speed. As the limit moves into the hundreds, it starts to increase
 in search time faster. Most array sizes were at their lowest time around the
 10-16 range, 12 being the most commonly lowest.

 It is difficult to draw too many strong conclusions about the data because as
 can be seen in the table there is a fair amount of fluctuation in the increase
 and decrease of times, even between two similar values. However, it seems safe
 to conclude that the sort time is lowest in a range of 4-30, and is lowest
 around 12-16, and gradually increases in sort time beyond 30, accelerating
 slowly as it passes into the hundreds. From this, then, we can assess the
 suggested 15 limit as a safe bet for being close to the best possible time for
 the algorithm. Comparing this test to using insertionSort() directly, or
 rather using quickSortX() with a limit value equal to the array size, results
 in sort times over 100 times slower, demonstrating the huge time saving the
 quickSort method results in.
